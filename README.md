# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a discipline of engineering that combine engineering principles, methods and tools to develop high-quality software systems.
In the tech industry, software engineering plays a role of developing appropriate high-quality software systems to improve communication and even representation of information which will eventually improve productivity and efficiency.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming languages; programming languages like fortan were discovered
establishment of software engineering as a discipline; software engineering became recognised as an engineering discipline.
advent of stractured programming; stractured programming was introduced in the 70s



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - documentation of user needs.
design - creating a high-quality design 
Implementation -bulding the software(coding)
testing - ensuring software is up to standard by conducting test
deployment - release of the project to users
maintainance - ensuring ongoing support


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology contains different phases namely; requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintainence while Agile is an iteractive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - responsible for writing code that gives functionality to a software.
project manager - responsible for over seeing the whole project, from planning to excecution.
quality assurance engineer - responsible for ensuring the software developed meets the standards.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - they provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code. example - pycharm
VCSs - they allow someone to keep track of the project changes and coordinationg work among members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines - regular assment of timelines and project goals.
changing requirements - effective communication.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - testing of individual components.
integration testing - testing of the interactions between the components.
system testing - testing the whole software.
acceptance testing - testing against the user requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - tell me about cars
improved prompt - tell me about electric cars and how they help the environment

specification; I have specified what type of car
clear; I have made clear the reason why I wabt to talk about the electric cars
